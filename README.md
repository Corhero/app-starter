# app-starter
A journey through time...

1. How did I get here?

Start by creating a repo on Github called 'app-starter'. Initialize it with a LICENSE and README.md. Then on my machine I did a git clone of the repo. I then proceeded to adding these lines of what I did to get the repo locally. I will now commit. Every single time I commit I will have reached a milestone. I will have to figure out a way to make this readme better as I go along.

2. Creating index.html

I will add an index.html with some basic markup. Done. It has a title and a H1. That's pretty much it. At this stage I can open the file in browser by navigating to 'file:///Users/cornelius/projects/app-starter/index.html'. This path will be different depending on what operating system you run, what your username is and where you store the files and folders. In this case I am on a Mac and my username is 'cornelius', I created a folder called 'projects' and that is also where I cloned this repo.
