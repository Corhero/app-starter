# app-starter
A journey through time...

##### 1. How did I get here?
* Start by creating a repo on Github called 'app-starter'. Initialize it with a LICENSE and README.md. Then on my machine I did a git clone of the repo. I then proceeded to adding these lines of what I did to get the repo locally. I will now commit. Every single time I commit I will have reached a milestone. I will have to figure out a way to make this readme better as I go along.

##### 2. Creating index.html
* I will add an index.html with some basic markup. Done. It has a title and a H1. That's pretty much it. At this stage I can open the file in browser by navigating to 'file:///Users/cornelius/projects/app-starter/index.html'. This path will be different depending on what operating system you run, what your username is and where you store the files and folders. In this case I am on a Mac and my username is 'cornelius', I created a folder called 'projects' and that is also where I cloned this repo.

##### 3. Adding style and basic JavaScript
* I want the heading in my 'index.html' to be blue. I also want to make the console print 'Hello World!'. I added a style tag in the head of my HTML. I also went and added a script tag at the bottom of my markup which says hello. When I hit refresh on my browser the colour is blue and the console says hello. Awesome! :P #commitandpushtomaster

##### 4. Github readme shows incorrect numbering on readme
* On github this readme shows my numbering incorrectly. I will have to look at the markdown style for Github and change this readme accordingly to do the numbering correctly. It's as if it is doing a list and always starting at 1 instead of the numbers I type into the markdown.
* I have now added asterisks below my numbering. Hopefully this will sort the issue out.
* This did not sort the issue. I've now opted to make each "list item" a heading instead. That seems to work.
