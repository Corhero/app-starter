# app-starter
A journey through time...

1. How did I get here?

Start by creating a repo on Github called 'app-starter'. Initialize it with a LICENSE and README.md. Then on my machine I did a git clone of the repo. I then proceeded to adding these lines of what I did to get the repo locally. I will now commit. Every single time I commit I will have reached a milestone. I will have to figure out a way to make this readme better as I go along.
